# Task 3 --- password generator  

# A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and random passwords for users.
# This project aims to create a password generator application using Python, 
# allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the password.


# User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of the password.
# Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.
# Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

# Import the random module
import random

# Define the characters that can be used in the password
characters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()"

# Ask the user for the length of the password
length = int(input("Enter the length of the password: "))

# Generate a random password by choosing characters from the list
password = ""
for i in range(length):
    password += random.choice(characters)

# Print the password
print("Your password is:", password)
